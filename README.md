## Intro

As React Native developers we often find ourselves scouring the interwebs to find information. Sometimes we are piecing together documentation from the native space and figuring out how to apply that to our cross platform development needs.

This documentation begins to create a collaborative space where we can share snippets and information.

In an effort to begin the collaboration sooner than later, we are starting with some tips on developing with Accessbility in mind.
