## Accessibility Guide For React Native

### What is Accessibility?
According to [blog post on Pusher](https://pusher.com/tutorials/accessible-react-native) it includes but is not limited to:

- **Visual impairments** - examples include low vision, color-blindness, and total blindness.
- **Physical or motor disabilities** - cerebral palsy, bone and joint deformities.
- **Mental disorders** - autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger’s syndrome, and autistic disorder.
- **Hearing impairment** - deafness and partial hearing loss.
- **Reading disabilities** - Dyslexia.

According to the same blog post, to really have an accessible app it means "... designing your apps in such a way that it takes all of these disabilities into consideration in order to make the user experience pleasant for everyone." For purposes of this guide the focus will start with Visual impairments.
