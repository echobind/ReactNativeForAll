# Image Accessibility
Accessibility for images can be very important especially for those utilizing screen reader technologies. The properties applied can let them know what the image is of as well as if it is simply an image, or if it is also a button that will  perform some other action.

### Properties:

* **accessibleRole:**  'image' | 'imageButton'

* **accessibilityLabel:** string to be read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image

* **accessible:** boolean, iOS only property that indicates whether or not the image is an accessibility element

Be mindful of the number of images used. Overuse of images can make it very challenging for visually impaired users.
